- **Use case** - Why is this enhancement needed?
- **Proposed solution** - How should it work?
- **Alternatives considered** - What other solutions did you think about?
- **Additional context** - Any other relevant information

### Code Contributions

#### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Simple issues perfect for beginners
- `help wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `documentation` - Help improve our docs

#### Pull Requests

1. **Small, focused changes** - One feature/fix per PR
2. **Include tests** - If adding functionality
3. **Update documentation** - If changing behavior
4. **Follow style guidelines** - Consistent code is easier to maintain

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose v2.0+
- Bash 4.0+
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vnc-cloudflared-docker.git
cd vnc-cloudflared-docker

# Create a branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and test
./vnc-client.sh test

# Run local validation
bash -n vnc-client.sh  # Syntax check
docker compose config  # Validate docker-compose.yml
```

### Testing

Before submitting a PR:

1. **Test basic functionality**:
   ```bash
   ./vnc-client.sh start
   ./vnc-client.sh status
   ./vnc-client.sh stop
   ```

2. **Test with different configurations**:
   - Different port numbers
   - Multiple profiles
   - Resource limits

3. **Check error handling**:
   - Missing configuration
   - Invalid values
   - Docker not running

## Style Guidelines

### Bash Script Guidelines

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- Set `set -euo pipefail` for error handling
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Prefer `[[ ]]` over `[ ]` for conditionals
- Use `readonly` for constants
- Quote variables: `"${var}"`

Example:
```bash
# Good
readonly CONFIG_FILE="${HOME}/.config/app.conf"
if [[ -f "${CONFIG_FILE}" ]]; then
    source "${CONFIG_FILE}"
fi

# Bad
config_file=$HOME/.config/app.conf
if [ -f $config_file ]; then
    source $config_file
fi
```

### Docker Guidelines

- Use official base images
- Run as non-root user
- Include HEALTHCHECK
- Add meaningful labels
- Minimize layers
- Use .dockerignore

### Documentation

- Use clear, simple English
- Include examples
- Explain the "why" not just "how"
- Keep line length under 80 characters
- Use markdown formatting consistently

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): subject

body

```
